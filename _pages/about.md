Welcome! I am an associate professor of finance in the [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I research and teach financial technology, crypto, and corporate finance. I also run the [UT Blockchain Initiative](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/centers-initiatives/blockchain-initiative/) on campus, and the [Fintech Research Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/fintechresearchlab/). Recently, I was a member of the State of Texas Work Group on Blockchain Matters (2021), and on academic leave as the chief economist of the [Coinbase Institute](https://www.coinbase.com/public-policy/advocacy/institute) (2022-2023).

I earned my MBA and PhD in Finance at [UCLA-Anderson](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/), and my BS/MS in Electrical Engineering at the [Politecnico di Milano, Italy](https://www.polimi.it/en/). My academic work has been published in top finance journals, including *the Journal of Finance*, *Journal of Financial Economics*, and *Management Science*. 

**News:** Sep 2025 - I just released the new paper *``No Country for Dirty Money? The Economic Footprint of Anti-Money Laundering Standards.''*, co-authored with Eric Lee and Tarik Roukny. We find that as countries go through an AML examination by FATF, cross-border trade goes down, FDI increases, ML detection goes up, and there is no significant impact on crime.
