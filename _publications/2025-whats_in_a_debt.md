abstract: 'In July 2013, Moody's unexpectedly increased the amount of equity credit that speculative-grade firms receive for preferred stock from 50% to 100%. Firms affected by the rule change were suddenly considered less levered by Moodys even though their balance sheets did not change. These firms responded by issuing debt, targeting a leverage ratio as defined by Moodys, and growing their assets. The rule change transferred value from bond to equity holders, and led to an increase in preferred stock issuance. How rating agencies assess risk thus has a significant causal impact on firms financing, investment, and security design decisions.'
