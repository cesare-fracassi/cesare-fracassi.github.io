Panelists are Ally Hoffman, the assistant vice president in banking supervision for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Raul Rodriguez (UT MBA ’13), the head of product management at frog; and Cesare Fracassi, an associate professor of finance, director of the McCombs School of Business’ Blockchain Initiative. The group will address questions on artificial intelligence and its power to reshape finance, from personalized banking to risk assessment and fraud detection. The panel will also speculate about AI’s future impact.
