This course surveys the common methodologies used in empirical corporate finance research, with an emphasis on practical issues. It also examines many of the important topics in corporate finance, including both seminal papers and working papers on the cutting edge of the field. The course is designed to help you learn how to do empirical research in corporate finance via a two-pronged approach: (1) Lectures, readings, and course assignments will help you understand the intuition behind each econometric method. (2) Student presentations, referee reports, and literature reviews will help you become familiar with the most important papers in the literature.
